# House-Prices-Prediction

#### If you ask a prospective purchaser to define their ideal home, they usually will not start by talking about how high the basement ceiling is or how close it is to an east-west railroad. However, the goal of this study demonstrate that factors other than the number of beds or a white picket fence have a significant impact on price discussions.

#### This project asks you to forecast the eventual price of each property using 79 explanatory factors that describe (nearly) every feature of residential dwellings in Ames, Iowa.

#### Program Components:
- Creative feature engineering 
- Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting
- Advanced preprocessing methodologies:
  - Dealing with ordinal and nominal values **[4 Methods]**
  - Dealing with missing values             **[8 Methods]**
  - Dealing with extraneous values **1 [Method]**
  - Finding the 'k' highly co-related 'SalePrice' attributes          **[1 Method]**
  - Removing duplicate values **[1 Method]**
- Illustrative visualizations
- In-depth testing with compared accuracy averages for every predictive model
