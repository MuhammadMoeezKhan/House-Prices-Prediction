# House-Prices-Prediction

#### The project is currently in the process of being completely uploaded, stay tuned (exciting!)!

#### If you ask a prospective purchaser to define their ideal home, they usually will not start by talking about how high the basement ceiling is or how close it is to an east-west railroad. However, the goal of this study demonstrates that factors other than the number of beds or a white picket fence have a significant impact on price discussions.

#### This project asks you to forecast the eventual price of each property using 79 explanatory factors that describe (nearly) every feature of residential dwellings in Ames, Iowa.

#### Program Components:
- Creative feature engineering 
- Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting
